# Calculator App

This is a calculator application built using React, Tailwind CSS, and React Router. It currently features SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) and EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) calculators. The project is under active development, and additional calculators such as mutual fund, home loan, etc., will be added in the future and Resposiveness will be added soon. I am regularly updating it.

## Features

- **SIP Calculator:** Calculates the future value of SIP investments based on user input.
- **EMI Calculator:** Computes the monthly EMI payments for loans based on principal amount, interest rate, and tenure.
- **Responsive Design:** The UI is currently under development, and responsiveness will be added soon. More UI enhancements and new features will also be added in the upcoming updates.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-app.git
